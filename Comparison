Traditional methods of diagnosing plant diseases are mainly based on professional diagnosis, which can quickly create delays in crop management and disease prevention. 
High levels of identification accuracy and speed are necessary since there are issues with many target regions and target kinds that are identical. 
Thus, it's essential to enhance and optimise the current procedures (CNN, RCNN, Fast RCNN, Faster RCNN, and SSD) to meet the detection needs. So, YOLO object detection method 
is used to identify plant leaf diseases which is a deep learning based approach. There are different versions of YOLO, proposed in the recent times, in that YOLOv5 model is 
considered one of the best model and the other is the recent version, YOLOv8 which was proposed in 2022. So, in this paper we compared the two models of YOLO, YOLOv5 and YOLOv8
on the same dataset, and found that for the dataset used the YOLOv5 model was found to be the better model with a mAP  of 0.641, while the YOLOv8 model has mAP of 0.516. 
By contrasting the YOLOv5 model with the most recent YOLOv8 model, which was presented in 2022, this study suggests that the YOLOv5 model is suitable for tasks involving the 
diagnosis of plant diseases. By utilising transfer learning capabilities, the YOLO model can be improved to broaden its application domain in the future.
